Sending emails from Django during development without using a real SMTP server. Python comes with a very basic and integrated SMTP server. To start it just open a terminal and type: python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025 Then configure your settings.py using the following parameters. You will see the email directly in the terminal â€¦
settings.py


if DEBUG:
    EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
    EMAIL_PORT = 1025
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'testing@example.com'




An even easier solution is to set the email backend to the console backend, as this doesn't require running an SMTP server in a separate process and results in email contents getting printed to stdout directly:

if DEBUG:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"
